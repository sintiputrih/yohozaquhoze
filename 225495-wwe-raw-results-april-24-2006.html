Last week saw Charlie Haas return to cost Shelton Benjamin his shot at RVD’s title shot. However, in a confusing turn of events, RVD is forced to put it on the line when he loses to the Sprit Squad. Vince McMahon unveiled ‘McMahonism’, Kane snapped, and Edge picked up his win in the series of handicapped matches between the main eventers of Backlash. Tonight is the go home edition of RAW before the Backlash PPV Sunday night.</p><p>RAW opens with a recap of the Vince McMahon-Shawn Michaels No Holds Barred Match from Wrestlemania 22, the highlights being Shane kissing his dad’s ass and getting caned, and of course the amazing ladder spot, setting up the match between Shane and Shawn later tonight. The pyro goes off and we get a good look at the huge crowd in the Wembley Arena.</p><p>Edge is the first wrestler out, and he is in street clothes. The Rated R Superstar puts over the Backlash Main Event and begins to rag on HHH. A replay of last week’s pinfall is shown. For Cena, we see a replay of Edge’s title win at New Year’s Revolution. Do we see a pattern here? It should be obvious that Edge will be the new champion. Triple H’s special “King of Kings” promo music plays, and Triple H gets a warm reception from the London crowd. It actually sounds like it was toned down in editing. He gets a Triple H chant. The H says Edge has come a long way. He says Edge acts, walks and talks like a champion. He even was a champion…for three weeks. He can go, but not for very long. Triple H does a funny impression of a guy who can’t last and the crowd eats it up. He says he can imagine it is frustrating for Lita. Triple H calls him the Premature Superstar. Until you can do it ten times in a row, you are not in H’s league. Edge says he only needs three seconds. Triple H was distracted by wanting to give Cena a lesson. But at Backlash, he only wants to be the 11 time WWE Champion. At Backlash, the King of Kings, well you know the rest. Edge says Triple H hasn’t been able to answer why he is in the Backlash Main Event. He lost at Mania and has never beaten Edge. Edge wonders if it is because he begged the old man on his knees. Triple H says there is only one person in the ring known for getting down on their knees. Triple H says if being on Vince’s good side benefits him, so be it. But he says he will also bash his Vince’s or even his own grandmother’s skull in if need be to win the title.</p><p>Cena comes out and he and Triple H start to brawl as Edge bails. Cena gets the upper hand with punches, but HHH is able to bail. He teases getting back in the ring, but the Spirit Squad come out. They have an announcement. The gist of it is that Cena, HHH, and Edge will be challenging the Spirit Squad in a 5 on 3 match.</p><p>Commercial.</p><p>On Unlimited, Matt Striker is ragging on the British people for butchering the American language, among other things. He promises the world will get an education from Matt Striker tonight.</p><p>Rewind – Matt Striker and Carlito go at it until Chris Masters beats down Carlito. Back to RAW, they play Regal’s old theme and I get confused. Chris Masters is out for a tag match. His partners, Matt Striker and IC Champ Shelton Benjamin. Their opponents are Carlito, RVD, and Charlie Haas.</p><p>Chris Masters, Matt Striker, & Shelton Benjamin vs. Charlie Haas, Carlito, & Rob Van Dam</p><p>The bell rings and Carlito and Shelton square off. Shelton takes him down and Carlito tags in RVD. They go back and forth until RVD nails a hurracanrana and kick. Striker gets thrown out and Masters double clotheslined out of the ring. Charlie Haas whips RVD in and he flips onto Striker and Masters. Commercial.</p><p>On Unlimited, Shelton and the heels get the upper hand, stomping RVD by the steel ring steps. Back in the ring, Benjamin punches RVD on the canvas. RVD punches back, but Shelton counters an Irish Whip with a spinebuster. Striker tags in and hits some punches and slaps. He chokes RVD in the corner. RVD gets a sunset flip, but Striker kicks out and trips RVD. Masters works on RVD’s back.</p><p>On RAW, the heels are still working on Van Dam. Masters locks in a bear hug. RVD breaks out, but Masters gets a powerslam for a two count that Carlito breaks up. Shelton is in and snap suplexes RVD and locks on a modified headlock. RVD gets out, and reverses an attempt by Shelton to get him in the corner. Charlie Haas cleans house. Back body drop and dropkick on Shelton. Inverted DDT gets a two count when Masters breaks it up. Carlito comes in and pokes Masters in the eyes. Striker punches Van Dam on the outside. In the ring, Carlito hits a backcracker on Benjamin, but Masters locks on the Masterlock. Haas breaks it up with a german suplex. Carlito hits a Rolling Cutter on Striker, Shelton hits the T Bone on Carlito, RVD gets a side kick, rolling thunder, and frog splash on Shelton for the 1-2-3.</p><p>Your winners, Rob Van Dam, Charlie Haas, and Carlito!</p><p>Commercial. Unlimited has the Kiss Cam. We get a proposal!</p><p>Back on RAW, Mr. McMahon is being interviewed by Todd Grisham. Vince refuses to believe that all the things that happened with the pyro were mere coincidences, not acts of God. He fired the pyro man. Shawn Michaels better hope there is an Act of God, but even if there is, he and his partner are going down. Vince has it on good authority that God is not in the building, so it is Vince’s son Shane one on one with Shawn Michaels. Shane says that this will be payback for what happened at Mania. Shane swears to God that Michaels will not be walking out on his own power.</p><p>Torrie is getting ready for the bikini contest. Kane is pacing (no voices). Show interrupts and wants to straighten things out with Kane. He wants to know what is going on. May 19th sets off Kane again. Show says it is like any other day. Kane warns him not to say it again, or else. Show repeats it and Kane lays into him, kicking Show against the garage door and flipping out on other wrestlers. Hey, is that Johnny Ace? Show is screaming that Kane injured his left eye. Commercial.</p><p>On Unlimited, Todd is out to host Sign of the Night. Someone wants Mania in England. What is Visagra? “Edge, in the UK you are rated 18″…funny! There is a follower of McMahonism in the crowd.</p><p>Back on RAW, Coach is in the ring for the Bikini Contest.
