Let’s start with the blue brand and the underdog story of the year, Jinder Mahal! Tonight Jinder puts his WWE Championship on the line against a fan favourite in the form of Shinsuke Nakamura. I’m curious how these two will gel inside the squared circle and who will come out on top because I could easily see it go either way. Let us know if you think the modern day Maharaja can retain and continue his dream year!</p><p>Raw’s main event couldn’t be more different as it features four behemoths with no rules. Brock Lesnar comes to SummerSlam to defend his Universal Championship against Roman Reigns, Braun Strowman, and Samoa Joe. Paul Heyman has promised that Brock will leave WWE forever if he loses his title tonight. There’s a lot on the line in this match and I personally hope to see Samoa Joe win the strap. Regardless of who wins though, we’re sure to see an absolute car wreck and I can’t wait!</p><p>Also on the summer blockbuster card, AJ Styles faces Kevin Owens for the United States Championship, with Shane McMahon acting as the guest referee. On the Raw side of things, Alexa Bliss defends her Women’s Championship against Sasha Banks, meanwhile SmackDown Women’s Champion Naomi puts her gold on the line against Natalya with Carmella waiting in the wings with her Money In The Bank Briefcase. Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose have put their differences aside and hope to dethrone Sheamus & Cesaro as the Tag Champs tonight, as well as The Uso’s challenging The New Day one last time.</p><p>That’s not even every match on the card tonight and there’s going to be at least two on the extra-long Kick-Off show which airs at 5 PM ET. SummerSlam’s main show airs at 7 PM ET and is likely to reach the four-hour mark. Remember to join in the conversation on the Ringside Talk app, as well as find all your news on the Ringside News app. This is the biggest show of the Summer folks, so strap in and enjoy!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-summerslam-kick-off-show>SummerSlam Kick-Off Show</h3><p>The pre-show starts with Renee Young welcoming us to the show and introducing her fellow panelists, Jerry “the King” Lawler, Lita, and David Otunga. They discuss their shoes for a moment before tossing to Charly Caruso in the social media lounge, where she will be joined later by Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins for a Q&A.</p><p>Your <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> Kickoff panel is ready to preview all the action: <a href=#>@ReneeYoungWWE</a> <a href=#>@JerryLawler</a> <a href=#>@AmyDumas</a> & <a href=#>@DavidOtunga</a>! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fK6OPWSGY4</a></p><p>— WWE SummerSlam (@SummerSlam) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Sam Roberts is outside the arena hanging out with a raucous crowd. The first match up for discussion is Baron&nbsp;Corbin Vs. John Cena and we get a&nbsp;recap of Corbin’s failed cash-in on SmackDown this week. We go backstage to an interview with Corbin himself. He says everybody knows what happened and it’s John Cena’s fault, so he doesn’t regret it, but he’s going to go out there and hurt Cena. And when you stick your people in nose’s business, there are consequences.</p><p>We return to the panel for a quick discussion of the tag title match before we take a&nbsp;commercial break.&nbsp;We come back to a video package for Finn Balor/Bray Wyatt. All of the panelists agree that Finn Balor bringing the Demon to SummerSlam spells doom for Bray Wyatt. Lita says the Demon is unstoppable and they all predict a Balor win.</p><p>A bit of hype for our preshow six-man tag follows, and then a house ad for the Mae Young Classic, before we get into the video package for the United States Championship match. We see footage of Owens and Styles’ rivalry, then Shane being announced as the referee only to be attacked by both men on different shows. Shane McMahon joins Dasha Fuentes backstage and she asks if what has transpired will play a role in his officiating tonight. Shane says that if it happens during the match it will likely be an accident and he will deem it as such unless he believes it to be intentional. Regardless, we will get a legit winner tonight.</p><p>We return to the panel and Otunga says that Kevin Owens is the most insecure Champion in WWE, so he blames everyone else for his shortcomings. Jerry Lawler says if history tells us anything, it’s that special referee’s always help determine the outcome of the matches. Lita says she would like to see AJ Styles win, simply because she would like a Kevin Owens tantrum. Otunga agrees with Lita but Lawler sides with Kevin Owens.</p><p>We head down to ringside for some tag team action, even though the arena is less than half full!</p><p>The <a href=#>#Miztourage</a> is on the set as <a href=#>@mikethemiz</a> <a href=#>@MaryseMizanin</a> <a href=#>@TheBoDallas</a> & <a href=#>@RealCurtisAxel</a> make their way to the ring! <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7v7QATrOEA</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-miz-curtis-axel-bo-dallas-w-maryse-vs-jason-jordan-the-hardy-boyz>The Miz, Curtis Axel & Bo Dallas W/Maryse Vs. Jason Jordan & The Hardy Boyz</h3><p>Matt and Curtis to start, collar and elbow, Hardy grabs a side headlock, Axel gets him in the corner and tries to break dirty with a right hand but Matt blocks it and makes the tag to Jeff. Poetry in Motion, dropkick to the back of the head gets two, an arm wringer and a tag to Jordan.</p><p>Curtis in control, he pulls Jason over and tags Bo in. Elbows to the corner, Jordan fights back with a few of his own, whip into a dropkick, the cover is only good for one but Kurt Angle’s biological son is rolling. Waistlock takedown to an armbar from Jordan and then a tag to Matt Hardy. Hardy off the second with an elbow drop to the shoulder that sends Dallas pirouetting, quick tags back and forth as the babyfaces work him over.

The second song had a line that said the people of Brooklyn have no balls and got a huge boo from the crowd – even Samson laughed at that.</p><p>Does Brooklyn want to walk with <a href=#>@IAmEliasWWE</a>? <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Un5uQR5qcK</a></p><p>— WWE SummerSlam (@SummerSlam) <a href=#>August 20, 2017</a></p><p>Carmella and James Ellsworth join the panel and the Princess of Staten Island gets a big reaction from the Brooklyn crowd.

Big E even tries a suicide dive, but a superkick cuts him off. Jey hits a Superfly Splash to Woods, but he kicks out at two. Near fall after near fall from both teams build the tension.</p><p>Woods jumps off of the apron and DDTs Jimmy on the outside &nbsp;before he and Big E hit the Midnight Hour for an extremely close two count.

Bray tries to escape the ring, so Balor dives over the top rope to take him out at ringside!</p><p>Wyatt suplexes Finn from the apron to the floor to take control. Wyatt hits a neckbreaker and tries to make a cover, but the ref refuses to count because Finn’s shoulder is slightly up. The Eater of Worlds puts him in a headlock, but a jawbreaker from Balor makes him release the hold. Balor counters Sister Abigail and stomps Wyatt in the chest with both feet. An overhead kick brings Wyatt down.</p><p>Don’t make <a href=#>#TheDemon</a> ANGRY! <a href=#>#SummerSlam</a> <a href=#>@FinnBalor</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BspQAVXdxf</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>August 21, 2017</a></p><p>Balor starts building momentum as he dropkicks Wyatt through the ropes before hitting a running kick on the apron. Both Balor and Wyatt trade some of their signature moves back and forth, but neither man can keep the other down for the three count. Wyatt takes Balor down once again and starts growing in confidence. Bray does the spider walk but Balor pops up and kicks him in the face. Wyatt is able to take Finn out with a hard clothesline. He does his spider walk, but Balor jumps up to his feet and stares at him. Wyatt is taken aback, so he runs at Balor but eats a slingblade followed by a dropkick into the corner and to&nbsp;finish him off: a Coup de Grace for the win.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-winner-finn-balor>Winner: Finn Balor</h3><p>A solid match and it’s nice to see Balor finally regain some momentum, one year after winning the WWE Universal Title in the very same building.</p><p>We get a video hyping the upcoming tag team title match and out first are the Champions!

The crowd went nuts for that. Cesaro gets thrown from the ring and lands awkwardly on his knee. Ambrose finally recovers and takes out Cesaro and Sheamus with a dive from the top rope to the floor. Rollins is able to make the tag and The Lunatic Fringe comes in hot with clotheslines for Cesaro.</p><p>The challengers send the champions out of the ring and hit twin suicide dives.

Strowman looks for a spear into the corner but Reigns moves and Braun hits the ring post and falls outside.
