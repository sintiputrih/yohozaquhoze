The NFL suspended Elliott for six games after a year-long investigation, but the decision was challenged by Elliott and the NFL Players Association in court. The case sparked a heated debate about the NFL’s handling of domestic violence cases, the credibility of the accuser and the accused, and the impact of the suspension on Elliott’s reputation and career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>Taylor, who had been abused by a former partner, spoke out about her experience and the challenges of proving and escaping an abusive relationship. She did not name her abuser, but she stated that she was lucky enough to get out of the abusive relationship and find happiness. She also expressed her empathy and understanding for other victims of domestic abuse and urged them to seek help and support. She also criticized the NFL for overcorrecting and creating more confusion and damage to the cause of domestic violence awareness. She said on her show:</p><p>“We talked a lot about absolute power today. With absolute power is also absolute responsibility. So we know the buck stops with Roger Goodell here. Here’s the issue: The damage done to the reputation of Ezekiel Elliott, no matter what comes out of this, is never going to change. It’s done. But what I’ve been saying this whole week is the damage that this does to domestic violence awareness by overcorrecting is far worse than everything else that we’re discussing. It’s so difficult to get people, once they’ve made a decision, to understand how serious it is. And for those of you who don’t know, I’ve survived domestic violence. Horrible things. I’ve had someone six-foot-two try to choke me and suffocate me at the same time. He’s thrown me downstairs, kicked me in my chest after dragging me out of the car. I can go on and on. So I know what I’m talking about. It’s very difficult. I’ve been in that he said/she said situation. And believe me, the she said was 100 percent right. But it’s very hard to prove it if it’s just you and them. If there’s a smoking gun, and I hesitate to say this because I understand that sometimes victims have things they don’t want out there, but when you’re dealing with public figures, when you’re dealing with the repercussions that are on this level with the NFL and the amount of people that consume this product, if there’s a smoking gun, it’s time. Time. Here we are. It’s time to put that forward and clear all this up.&nbsp;You can’t come out with a six-game suspension for Ezekiel Elliott. “</p><p>Taylor’s statement was courageous and powerful, as she revealed her own trauma and called for more clarity and accountability from the NFL and the parties involved in the case.&nbsp;She also expressed empathy for both Thompson and Elliott, acknowledging the difficulty of proving abuse and the lasting damage to one’s reputation. She did not take sides but rather urged for more evidence and transparency to resolve the case.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joy Taylor: A Voice of Diversity</h2><p>One of Joy Taylor’s personal goals is to foster diversity in the industry of communication.

Taylor said that watching Hill on ESPN gave her the confidence and motivation to pursue her dream of becoming a sports opinionist.</p><p>“My hope is the more that young black women see us on television that idea that you can do this also,” Taylor said. “I mean that’s what it was for me watching Jemele Hill on ESPN like I was able to see like okay not only is she on television every day she’s doing what I want to do which is give her opinion and she’s equal to all the men on the show and for me that made me to believe it could happen right.”</p><p>Taylor also acknowledged the challenges and barriers that women and people of color face in the sports industry, which is still dominated by white men. She said that she has learned to overcome the doubts and criticisms from others and herself, and to trust her abilities and voice.</p><p>“It’s so much harder to create something and know you can do something and no one else can see you in that space,” Taylor said. “But when someone’s already done it before you and you see the representation of yourself on television that inspires the ability to believe that you can do it and to follow that path.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joy Taylor: A Foundation for Change</h2><p>Joy Taylor is not only a successful media personality, but also a generous philanthropist and a passionate advocate for diversity and social justice.</p><p>As a Barry University alumna, Joy Taylor has shown her gratitude and support for her alma mater by establishing a scholarship for students pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Communication disciplines.
