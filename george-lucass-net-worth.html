Lucas’s Net Worth</h3><p><strong>A multi-talented director, writer, producer, and businessman, George Lucas’s Net Worth is a staggering $10 billion.</strong></p><p>It all comes down to a brilliant business choice he made in 1973 while negotiating his salary for the first Star Wars film.</p><p>Following the phenomenal success of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>American Graffiti</strong></a>, Lucas was entitled to a $500,000 compensation for his next film. As a result, that was a big increase over his Graffiti salary of $150,000.</p><p>Instead of accepting the roughly 300 percent compensation increase, George proposed to the Fox executives.</p><p>George graciously offered to keep his salary at $150,000 in exchange for two seemingly minor requests: #1) He keeps all merchandising rights, and #2) that he keeps all sequel rights.</p><p>The offer delighted Fox executives, who believed George’s space film would be little more than a blip on the entertainment radar. Obviously, this was a terrible deal for Fox, and George received possibly the greatest film contract in history.</p><p>Let’s have a look at his earnings from the year 1968 to 2013:</p><table class="table biofactstable"><tbody><tr><th>Year</th><td><strong>Earnings</strong></td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-adjust"></i>1968</th><td>$3,000</td></tr><tr><th>1969</th><td>$3,000</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-tower"></i>1971</th><td>$15,000</td></tr><tr><th>1973</th><td>$50,000</td></tr><tr><th>1977</th><td>$200,000</td></tr><tr><th>1981</th><td>$2,900,000</td></tr><tr><th>1999</th><td>$400,000,000</td></tr><tr><th>2005</th><td>$290 Million</td></tr><tr><th>2006</th><td>$180,000,000</td></tr><tr><th>2010</th><td>$100,000,000</td></tr><tr><th>2012</th><td>$4,050,000,000</td></tr><tr><th>2013</th><td>$195,700,000</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>George Lucas’s Income</h3><p><strong>George Lucas’s income is estimated to be around $2 billion as of 2023.</strong></p><p>Star Wars had made $20 billion in product sales and $4 billion in home entertainment sales by 2012.</p><p>On October 30th, 2012, George Lucas stated that he had struck an agreement to sell his entire Lucasfilm company to Disney for a whopping $4.1 billion in cash and equity.</p><p>Lucas held 100 percent of the corporation, which meant he pocketed the entire $4 billion.

He bought the ranch in 1978 and has spent more than $100 million transforming it into a private house, movie studio, retreat, and 300-seat screening theater.</p><p>Also, there’s a 50,000-square-foot private residence on the site and swimming pools, tennis courts, and other amenities.</p><p>Approximately 5,000 acres of the property have been protected in a perpetual conservation easement with the Marin County Agricultural Land Trust.</p><p>He paid $33.9 million for a 9,000-square-foot mansion in Los Angeles’ Bel Air district in 2017.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lucas-house.jpg><p>In addition, he bought a seaside mansion in Carpinteria, California, for $19.5 million in 2010. (just south of Santa Barbara). He demolished the old house and replaced it with a considerably larger Cape Cod-style dwelling.</p><p>Also, George paid $28 million for the house next door in December 2019. Frances Morehart, who died in 2018 at the age of 93, was the property’s previous owner next door. In Carpinteria, his new combined beachfront footprint is over 3-acres.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Even though George is a billionaire, he isn’t much of a car person. Hence, he doesn’t have car collections.</p><p>He admits, “<strong>I don’t actually collect vehicles.</strong>” “I own a 1974 Ferrari Dino, a Ferrari 360 Modena, and a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, as well as two Tuckers (vintage American 1940s cars).” That’s the end of it.”</p><p>However, Lucas’s fascination with automobiles began long before he could drive, and it would turn out to be the major topic of his youth.</p><h4><strong>Ferrari 360 Modena</strong></h4><p>George Lucas has a Ferrari F360 with a 3.6-liter V8 engine positioned in the middle, which costs roughly $80,000-$90,000. At 8,500 rpm, it produces 400 horsepower.</p><p>The 360 sports an aluminum space-frame chassis, adjustable aluminum double-wishbone suspension, and a flawlessly smooth body.</p><h4>Fiat Bianchina</h4><p>The “Fiat Bianchina” was a coupe car designed by George Lucas and based on the Fiat 500, which he got as a gift from his father. It costs somewhere around $10,000 to $13,000.</p><p>Shortly after receiving the automobile, the Hollywood movie mogul modified it for racing and enjoyed fast trips until he was hospitalized after crashing it on a public road.</p><h4>Mosler MT900S: $203,000</h4><p>Lucas is the proud owner of an MT900S, a supercar built by Mosler, a niche automaker. He purchased the car as soon as it was introduced in 2006, and it was the first model to leave the factory.</p><p>The Molser drew Lucas in because of its speed, power, and agility, and he supposedly fell in love with it after seeing it on the cover of a magazine. It’s not quite the Millennium Falcon, but it’ll do for now.</p><h3>Gulfstream G550 Private Jet: $61 Million</h3><p>Lucas takes to the skies in his Gulfstream G550 whenever he wants to go large distances. This corporate jet has a plush interior and can accommodate up to 19 passengers. The call sign N138GL is painted on Lucas’s jet, which is a hue of dark crimson.</p><p>Some assume that the number 138 refers to Lucas’ debut feature picture, THX: 1138, but no one knows for sure.</p><p><strong>Read more about: <a href=# rel=noopener>Abigail Disney’s Net Worth: Lifestyle & Movie</a></strong></p><h2>George Lucas: Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Despite amassing a fortune that most mainstream directors would kill for, Lucas is frugal with his money. He promised to donate the majority of his money to charity after the Disney sale.</p><p>Also, he’s given billions of dollars to numerous charities throughout the years, with a particular focus on improving education for low-income pupils.</p><p>While Lucas has a strong proclivity for providing, he isn’t fully free of self-indulgence. He may not lavish as much as other billionaires, but he has amassed a sizable fortune.</p><h4>Saying Grace By Norman Rockwell: $46 Million</h4><p>If there’s one thing Lucas enjoys doing, it’s collecting Norman Rockwell paintings. Lucas grew up viewing Rockwell’s work on the cover of The Saturday Evening Post, where he was known for his sympathetic depictions of American life.</p><p>‘Saying Grace,’ which sold for $46 million at auction, is perhaps the most valuable piece in his collection. SF Gate believes that Lucas is the owner, although the buyer’s name is kept unknown.</p><h4>His Entire Art Collection Worth $1 Billion</h4><p>Lucas has an art collection that matches most galleries, in addition to the Rockwells. While most of it is made up of pop art that Lucas has collected over the years, it also includes artifacts from practically all of his films, including the Star Wars franchise.</p><p>Lucas, ever the altruistic man, does not hoard his wealth for himself. He lends artifacts from his collection to galleries across the country regularly, allowing the public to see them.</p><h4>Museum Of Narrative Art: $1 Billion</h4><p>The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, set to open in 2021, is a museum dedicated to the craft of storytelling via visual expression.</p><p>Lucas is now self-funding the museum, including a $400 million endowment that he plans to utilize to get things started once the doors open.</p><h2>Vacation</h2><p>Due to a busy schedule, Lucas hardly takes any vacation. However, his shooting for different TV shows allows him to travel across the world.</p><p>“<strong>Star wars</strong>” solely let him travel places like:</p><ul><li>Villa del Balbianello, Italy</li><li>Redwood National and State Parks, California</li><li>Royal Palace of Caserta, Italy</li><li>Matmata, Tunisia</li><li>Skellig Michael, Ireland</li><li>Mos Espa, Tunisia</li><li>Plaza de España, Spain</li><li>Tikal, Guatemala</li></ul><h2>Disney Sale, Star Wars, Movie, Book Publications</h2><h3>Disney Sale</h3><p>George sold the Star Wars franchise rights to Disney for $4 billion in cash and equity in 2012.</p><p>Lucas received $2.21 billion in cash and 37 million shares of stock (37,076,679), valued at roughly $50 at the time.</p><p>As a result, he received $1.85 billion in Disney stock after the deal was completed. Lucas makes about $64 million per year in dividend payments thanks to his share count and Disney’s semi-annual $0.88 payout.</p><p>With Disney’s stock hitting $200 in March 2021, the 37 million shares had grown to be worth $7.4 billion.</p><h3>Star Wars</h3><p>Star Wars, made on a budget of $11 million and premiered in 1977, became a worldwide hit. Lucas would spend $15 million on restoration costs for the film’s re-release decades later.</p><p>In the early 1980s, two more sequels to Star Wars were released, both enormously successful and continued to expand the Star Wars universe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/lucas-in-starwars.jpg><p>Lucas directed a second Star Wars trilogy in the late 1990s and early 2000s, concentrating on events before the original films.
